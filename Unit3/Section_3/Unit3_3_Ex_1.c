/*
You are developing an elixir that supposedly makes a person younger.
You just need to get the software working correctly before starting to market your product. 
Your program keeps track of a person's age, but in order to be more secretive you work with 
a pointer rather than the variable that stores the age directly. 

You are provided with a main function -- please complete it. 
Do not change any of the lines of code that have already been completed. 
Please only change the lines that are currently comments.

Provided code
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    int age;

    // add a line here that declares an integer pointer named "ageptr"

    scanf("%d", &age);

    // add a line here that stores the address of age in ageptr  

    printf("The secret address is... ");

    // add a line here that prints out the address stored in ageptr  

    printf("Now take three drops of the magic elixir. \n");

    // add a line that uses only ageptr to lower the age by 5 years

    printf("Did the elixir work? You are %d years old!", age);

    return 0;

}
Example

Input:
45

Output
The secret address is...fffc                                                    
Now take three drops of the magic elixir.                                       
Did the elixir work? You are 40 years old!
