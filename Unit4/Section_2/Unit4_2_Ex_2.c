/*
Your goal is to read a 68-word text from the input and then print it to the screen backwards. 
Individual words do not have to be spelled backwards, but rather your program should print out the last word first, 
then the second-to-last word, etc. No word has more than 40 characters.

"The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that
human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic
and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way an algorithm works and to convince a 
reader that the results will be correct." ― Donald Ervin Knuth, Selected Papers on Computer Science
